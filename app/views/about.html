            Not quite yet, but we’re working on it every day. Right now, we're in Beta mode in the US, so try it out! 
            We need your help telling the current system manufacturers and dealers to make the Tinker design system available everywhere.

            Modern wheelchairs offer you thousands of customizable choices.  
            Color, size, and style can all be changed to your liking.  
            Unfortunately, the process of making those choices is still trapped in the stone age.  
            It is heavily reliant on paper order forms, endless phone calls, and long meetings with the vendor.  
            It’s inevitable that there will be a miscommunication on at least one detail that you specifically wanted on your chair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tinker is the answer to these challenges.  
            For the first time, you can design your wheelchair start to finish in a visual and fun way.  
            Tinker is about choice and giving you the power to build the chair that you want.

            Tinker is simply a catalog of all of the options that a manufacturer makes available.  
            Right now, we only have two chairs made by TiArrow in Sweden, but with your support we’ll grow to have more manufacturers based in the US and the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best part about Tinker is that it works with the system of experts that are already here to help you choose the best equipment for your disability.  
            Your dealer, ATPs, and therapists can all log in and see the chair that you want.

            We’re looking for new manufacturers who want to help us shake up the industry.  
            Tinker can be a standalone website, or it can be customized to run as though it was part of the manufacturer's website.  
            Just contact us at sales@intelliwheels.net to see how we can work together.
